US Birth Rate Analysis: Understanding and Usage
Overview
The US Birth Rate Analysis project aims to provide insights into birth trends in the United States from 1994 to 2014. The Jupyter Notebook (US_BirthRate_Analysis_.ipynb) covers data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. Here's how you can use and benefit from this analysis:

Understanding the Data
1. Explore Birth Trends
Inspection: Start by checking out the dataset, understanding its structure, and gaining an overview of birth-related data.
Statistics: Dive into key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and more to comprehend the distribution of birth rates.
2. Visualizing Insights
Trend Analysis: Utilize visualizations (bar plots and kernel density estimate plots) to identify trends and patterns in birth rates over the given years.
Interactive Exploration
3. Interactive Plot with Plotly Express
Dynamic Exploration: Engage with an interactive line plot using Plotly Express, allowing users to explore average daily birth rates with ease.
User-Friendly: The interactive nature of the plot enhances user experience, making it accessible for a broader audience.
Understanding Relationships
4. Correlation Matrix
Feature Relationships: Generate a correlation matrix to understand how different features (e.g., year, month) relate to each other.
Structural Insights: Visualize the matrix to gain insights into the structural relationships within the dataset.
Predictive Modeling
5. Linear Regression Predictions
Forecasting Births: Train a linear regression model to predict future birth rates based on historical data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.
